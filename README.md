Developing various methods for distant reading of Persianate texts.

- [k-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering): statistical method for using vectors to assess similarity between texts (often performed using [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)).
  - Article about how the [Kitab project](http://kitab-project.org/2019/11/14/judging-the-difference-between-different-arabic-text-versions-mathematically/) assesses similarity between Arabic texts.

Python-based hosting packages:
- [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)

Interactive Python Shell:
- Run with `ipython3`, then `import`.
  - or, do it all at once: `ipython3 -i -c"import text_deciphering_tool  as td"`
